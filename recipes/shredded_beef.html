    <h3>How to Serve Shredded Beef</h3>
    <p>
      Every cook and family has it own variation and ways to serve it. This is
      my Colombian version and I like to serve it over white rice with ripe
      plantain and avocado on the side. This classic beef dish is also great on
      top of patacones and arepas. It can also be used as a filling for tacos or
      empanadas.
